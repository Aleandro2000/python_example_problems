## Problem 1:
Write a function called ‘largest_unique_number’ that takes in a list of integers as input and returns the largest unique number in the list. If there are no unique numbers, return -1.

## Problem 2:
Write a function called ‘remove_duplicates’ that takes in a list as input and returns a new list with duplicate elements removed. The order of the elements should be preserved.

## Problem 3:
Write a function called ‘reverse_words’ that takes in a string as input and returns a new string with the words reversed. Words in the input string are separated by a single space.
## Problem 4:
Write a function called ‘find_missing_number’ that takes in a list of integers from 1 to N (inclusive) with one number missing, and returns the missing number.

## Problem 5:
Write a function called ‘is_anagram’ that takes in two strings as input and returns True if the strings are anagrams (contain the same characters in any order), and False otherwise.

## Problem 6:
Write a function called ‘validate_palindrome’ that takes in a string as input and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward), and False otherwise. The function should ignore whitespace and non-alphanumeric characters.

## Problem 7:
Write a function called ‘prime_factors’ that takes in an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
## Problem 8:
Write a function called ‘count_words’ that takes in a string as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique words in the string and the values are the counts of each word.

## Problem 9:
Write a function called ‘matrix_transpose’ that takes in a matrix (a list of lists) as input and returns the transpose of the matrix.

## Problem 10:
Write a function called ‘binary_search’ that takes in a sorted list of integers and a target integer as input, and returns the index of the target integer in the list. If the target integer is not found, return -1.

# NOTES
The matrix element must be introducet in the different lines when you choose the problem 9.
